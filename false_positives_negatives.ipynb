    "# H. Pylori\n",
    "*Helicobacter Pylori* is a type of bacteria that can cause infections in the stomach. Symptoms of *H. pylori* include painful stomach ulcers. A common test for the infection is the urea breath test. After the patient ingests a tablet or drink containing urea enriched with the isotope carbon-13 (rather than the usual carbon-12), the test measures the proportion of carbon-13 in the carbon dioxide in the collected breath sample. If the amount of carbon-13 is in excess of the normal amount of carbon-13 in one's breath, then it suggests the presence of the bacteria in the stomach, because the bacteria have converted the ingested urea into carbon dioxide. The test result is how much excess carbon-13 is found in one's breath. For example, a test result of 5 means that there is 5 times as much carbon-13 as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "As study was done to find the distribution of the urea test results of subjects with or without *H. pylori* infection. Below is a histogram that shows the number of patients with a particular test result. Patients without the infection are plotted in blue; those who are infected are plotted in orange.\n",
