    "In a previous notebook on truffula trees, we looked at the causal relationship between the number of bees and the number of fruits. We concluded that the \"bees cause fruits\". That is, if more bees come near the tree, then more fruits will grow. Of course, bees are not the only cause of fruiting, so this time we would like to investigate if watering the trees with particular supplements will help with fruiting as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "With all the hype around kombucha in Berkeley, Hans decides to perform the following experiment. He has a 1000 metre by 1000 metre orchard, so he divides the orchard into two halves. The eastern half receives water, and the western half receives kombucha. After a summer, he compares the two experimental groups to see if trees in one group has a higher number of fruits than the other group.\n",
    "\n",
    "His experiment can be represented through our setup interface as follows. In the __East (Water)__ group, he selects 250 trees in a range of longitudes (east-west location) from 0 to 500 m measured from the easternmost edge of his orchard and fixes the supplement to be the regular __Water__. In the __West (Kombucha)__ group, he selects 250 trees in a range of longitudes from 500 to 1000 m and fixes the supplement to be __Kombucha__."
